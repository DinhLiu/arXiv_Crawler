	abstract = {Low stiffness, large stroke, and axial force capabilities make Extensile Fluidic Artificial Muscles (EFAMs) a feasible soft actuator for continuum soft robots. EFAMs can be used to construct soft actuated structures that feature large deformation and enable soft robots to access large effective workspaces. Although FAM axial properties have been well studied, their bending behavior is not well characterized in the literature. Static and dynamic bending properties of a cantilevered EFAM specimen were investigated over a pressure range of 5–100 psi. The static properties were then estimated using an Euler-Bernoulli beam model and discrete elastic rod models. The experiments provided data for the determination of bending stiffness, damping ratio, and natural frequency of the tested specimen. The bending stiffness and the damping ratio were found to change fourfold over the pressure range. Experimentally validated bending properties of the EFAM presented insights into structural and control considerations of soft robots. Future work will utilize the data and models obtained in this study to predict the behavior of an EFAM-actuated continuum robot carrying payloads.},

The arm’s primary deformation is bending, coupled with extension or compression, but the strains experienced can be high, the materials are generally nonlinear, and the deformations are large. Existing work has focused on models intended to improve control, which rely on post-manufacturing empirical characterization of each arm design. This article presents a quasi-static model based on Euler–Bernoulli beam theory that generalizes across a broad set of arm designs. The model is implemented for ﬂuid-driven soft arms constructed with McKibben actuators. Actuators are treated as active materials, and their force is characterized as a nonlinear function of pressure and uniaxial strain. The model is validated for multiple soft arms under external loads, and further use is demonstrated through an investigation of the soft arms’ loaded workspace. Higher load capacities are shown to be concentrated at the arms’ midlines. Distal taper is examined in an example arm design, and is shown to improve range of motion and load resistance when compared to a constant width arm. The model can be used to evaluate variations on the number and arrangement of actuators in an arm, and it is proposed as a ﬁrst order design and analysis method for soft robot arms.},

Existing models are successful at improving control of individual arms but do not give insight into how the structure of the arm affects the arm’s capabilities. For example, omnidirectional soft robot arms most frequently have three parallel actuators, but may have four or more, while common biological arms, including octopuses, have tens of distinct longitudinal muscle bundles. This article presents a quasi-static analytical model of soft arms bent with longitudinal actuators, based on equilibrium principles and assuming an unknown neutral axis location. The model is presented as a generalizable framework and specifically implemented for an arm with [Formula: see text] fluid-driven actuators, a subset of which are pressurized to induce a bend with a certain curvature and direction. The presented implementation is validated experimentally using planar (2D) and spatial (3D) bends. The planar model is used to initially estimate pressure for a closed-loop curvature control system and to bound the accessible configurations for a rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) motion planner. A three-segment planar arm is demonstrated to navigate along a planned trajectory through a gap in a wall. Finally, the model is used to explore how the arm morphology affects maximum curvature and directional resolution. This research analytically connects soft arm structure and actuator behavior to unloaded arm performance, and the results may be used to methodically design soft robot arms.},

The emergence of soft-bodied robots brings a new perspective to solving this problem. In this paper, inspired by humans performing interaction tasks through simple behaviors, we propose a hierarchical control system for soft arms, in which the low-level controller achieves motion control of the arm tip, the high-level controller controls the behaviors of the arm based on the low-level controller, and the top-level planner chooses what behaviors should be taken according to tasks. To realize the motion control of the soft arm in interacting with environments, we propose two control methods. The first is a feedback control method based on a simplified Jacobian model utilizing the motion laws of the soft arm that are not affected by environments during interaction. The second is a control method based on [Formula: see text]-learning, in which we present a novel method to increase training data by setting virtual goals. We implement the hierarchical control system on a platform with the Honeycomb Pneumatic Networks Arm (HPN Arm) and validate the effectiveness of this system on a series of typical daily interaction tasks, which demonstrates this proposed hierarchical control system could render the soft arms to perform interaction tasks as simply as humans, without force sensors or accurate models of the environments. This work provides a new direction for the application of soft-bodied arms and offers a new perspective for the physical interactions between robots and environments.},

            Soft manipulator is a kind of special manipulator that uses soft material or flexible structure to perform manipulation task under the specific drive mode inspired by the soft tissue. It is developing gradually as an important component of the soft robot. In this paper, the typical design cases of the soft manipulators as well as the related research teams are firstly investigated. The characteristics of different drive modes are compared and analyzed. Based on these investigations, the enabling technologies are systematically summarized in five aspects, such as kinematic and dynamic modeling, motion control, shape detection, dynamic tactile perception, and stiffening method. Currently, the research on soft manipulator has initially formed a technical system, although it is still in the primary stage. With the development of the soft manipulator, its overall technology maturity will be gradually improved. Currently, the applications of the soft manipulator lie mainly in the fields of the ground rescue, the underwater grabbing, the medical operation, the assist maintenance, the man–machine interaction, the space manipulation and so on. The application fields, such as origami soft manipulator, biomimetic soft microrobots, self‐healing soft robot, space soft manipulator and so on, emerge new opportunities and challenges for the soft manipulators.},

            The development and use of architectured structures is changing the means by which we design and fabricate soft robots. These materials utilize their topology and geometry to control physical and mechanical structural properties. We propose an architectured structure based on trimmed helicoids that allows for independent regulation of the bending and axial stiffness which facilitates tuneability of the resulting soft robot properties. Leveraging FEA and computational analysis we select a geometry that provides an optimal trade-off between controllability, sensitivity to errors in control, and compliance. By combining these modular trimmed helicoid structures in conjunction with control methods, we demonstrate a meter-scale soft manipulator that shows control precision, large workspace, and compliant interactions with the environment. These properties enable the robot to perform complex tasks that leverage robot-human and robot-environment interactions such as human feeding and collaborative object manipulation.},

This paper presents a model-based design approach to effectively increase the payload capacity of soft robot arms. The proposed approach uses localized body stiffening to decrease the compliance at the end effector without sacrificing the robot’s range of motion. This approach is validated on both a simulated and a real soft robot arm, where experiments show that increasing the stiffness of localized regions of their bodies reduces the compliance at the end effector and increases the height to which the arm can lift a payload. By increasing the payload capacity of soft robot arms, this approach has the potential to improve their efficacy in a variety of tasks including object manipulation and exploration of cluttered environments.

	abstract = {Soft robots aim to revolutionize how robotic systems interact with the environment thanks to their inherent compliance. Some of these systems are even able to modulate their physical softness. However, simply equipping a robot with softness
will not generate intelligent behaviors. Indeed, most interaction tasks require careful specification of the compliance at the interaction point; some directions must be soft and others firm (e.g., while drawing, entering a hole, tracing a surface, assembling components). On the contrary without careful planning, the preferential directions of deformation of a soft robot are not aligned with the task. With this work, we propose a strategy to prescribe variations of the physical stiffness and the robot’s posture so to implement a desired Cartesian stiffness and location
of the contact point. We validate the algorithm in simulation and with experiments. To perform the latter, we also present a new tendon-driven soft manipulator, equipped with variable-stiffness segments and proprioceptive sensing and capable to move in 3D. We show that, combining the intelligent hardware with the
proposed algorithm, we can obtain the desired stiffness at the end-effector over the workspace.},

We first solve this problem analytically for a tendon-embedded Euler-Bernoulli beam. Nondimensionalized equations and plots describe how tendon stretch and routing path affect the robot's output stiffness at any point. These analytical results enable stiffness analysis of candidate robot designs without extensive computational simulations. Insights gained through this analysis include the ability to increase robot stiffness by using converging tendon paths. Generalizing to large deflections in three dimensions (3-D), we extend a previous nonlinear Cosserat-rod-based model for tendon-driven robots to handle prescribed tendon displacements, tendon stretch, pretension, and slack. We then provide additional dimensionless plots in the actuated case for loads in 3-D. The analytical formulas and numerically computed model are experimentally validated on a prototype robot with good agreement.},

	abstract = {Continuum manipulators offer many advantages compared to their rigid-linked counterparts, such as increased degrees of freedom and workspace volume. Inspired by biological systems, such as elephant trunks and octopus tentacles, many continuum manipulators are made of multiple segments that allow large-scale deformations to be distributed throughout the body. Most continuum manipulators currently control each segment individually. For example, a planar cable-driven system is typically controlled by a pair of cables for each segment, which implies two actuators per segment. In this article, we demonstrate how highly coupled crossing cable conﬁgurations can reduce both actuator count and actuator torque requirements in a planar continuum manipulator, while maintaining workspace reachability and manipulability. We achieve highly coupled actuation by allowing cables to cross through the manipulator to create new cable conﬁgurations. We further derive an analytical model to predict the underactuated manipulator workspace and experimentally verify the model accuracy with a physical system. We use this model to compare crossing cable conﬁgurations to the traditional cable conﬁguration using workspace performance metrics. Our work here focuses on a simpliﬁed planar robot, both in simulation and in hardware, with the goal of extending this to spiraling-cable conﬁgurations on full 3D continuum robots in future work.},

	abstract = {Developing high-strength continuum robots can be challenging without compromising on the overall size of the robot, the complexity of design and the range of motion. In this work, we explore how the load capacity of continuum robots can drastically be improved through a combination of backbone design and convergent actuation path routing. We propose a rhombus-patterned backbone structure composed of thin walled-plates that can be easily fabricated via 3D printing and exhibits high shear and torsional stiffness while allowing bending. We then explore the effect of combined parallel and converging actuation path routing and its influence on continuum robot strength. Experimentally determined compliance matrices are generated for straight, translation and bending configurations for analysis and discussion. A robotic actuation platform is constructed to demonstrate the applicability of these design choices.},

	abstract = {Octopuses can employ their tapered arms to catch prey of all shapes and sizes due to their dexterity, ﬂexibility, and gripping power. Intrigued by variability in arm taper angle between different octopus species, we explored the utility of designing soft actuators exhibiting a distinctive conical geometry, compared with more traditional cylindrical forms. We ﬁnd that these octopus-inspired conical-shaped actuators exhibit a wide range of bending curvatures that can be tuned by simply altering their taper angle and they also demonstrate greater ﬂexibility compared with their cylindrical counterparts. The taper angle and bending curvature are inversely related, whereas taper angle and applied bending force are directly related. To further expand the functionality of our soft actuators, we incorporated vacuum-actuated suckers into the actuators for the production of a fully integrated octopus arm-inspired gripper. Notably, our results reveal that because of their enhanced ﬂexibility, these tapered actuators with suckers have better gripping power than their cylindrical-shaped counterparts and require signiﬁcantly larger forces to be detached from both ﬂat and curved surfaces. Finally, we show that by choosing appropriate taper angles, our tapered actuators with suckers can grip, move, and place a remarkably wide range of objects with ﬂat, nonplanar, smooth, or rough surfaces, as well as retrieve objects through narrow openings. The results from this study not only provide new design insights into the creation of next-generation soft actuators for gripping a wide range of morphologically diverse objects but also contribute to our understanding of the functional signiﬁcance of arm taper angle variability across octopus species.},

Hence, the current work presents a computational method developed to ﬁnd optimal designs of continuum robots given reachability constraints. First, we leverage both forward and inverse kinematic computations to perform reachability analysis in an efﬁcient yet accurate manner. While implementing inverse kinematics, we also integrate torque minimization at joints such that robot conﬁgurations with the minimum actuator torque required to reach a given workspace could be found. Lastly, we apply an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to ﬁnd optimal robot dimensions while considering reachability, where the objective function could be the total length of the robot or the actuator torque required to operate the robot. Through three application problems, we show that the EDA is superior to a genetic algorithm (GA) in ﬁnding better solutions within a given number of iterations, as the objective values of the best solutions found by the EDA are 4-15\% lower than those found by the GA.},

            Compliant, continuum structures allow living creatures to perform complex tasks inaccessible to artificial rigid systems. Although advancements in hyper-elastic materials have spurred the development of synthetic soft structures (i.e., artificial muscles), these structures have yet to match the precise control and diversity of motions witnessed in living creatures. Cephalopods tentacles, for example, can undergo multiple trajectories using muscular hydrostat, a structure consisting of aggregated laminae of unidirectional muscle fibers. Here, we present a self-adhesive composite lamina inspired by the structural morphology of the muscular hydrostat, which adheres to any volumetrically expanding soft body to govern its motion trajectory. The composite lamina is stretchable only in one direction due to inextensible continuous fibers unidirectionally embedded within its hyper-elastic matrix. We showcase reconfiguration of inflation trajectories of two- and three-dimensional soft bodies by simply adhering laminae to their surfaces.},

Inspired by biological systems, engineers have started to explore origami folding in combination with smart material actuators to enable intrinsic actuation as a means to decouple design from fabrication complexity. The built-in crease structure of origami bodies has the potential to yield compliance and exhibit many soft body properties. Conventional fabrication of robots is generally a bottom-u p assembly process with multiple low-level steps for creating subsystems that include manual operations and often multiple iterations. By contrast, natural systems achieve elegant designs and complex functionalities using top-down parallel transformation approaches such as folding. Folding in nature creates a wide spectrum of complex morpho-functional structures such as proteins and intestines and enables the development of structures such as flowers, leaves and insect wings. Inspired by nature, engineers have started to explore folding powered by embedded smart material actuators to create origami robots. The design and fabrication of origami robots exploits top-d own, parallel transformation approaches to achieve elegant designs and complex functionalities.

Multimaterial-based design freedom of origami robots creates functional versatility; however, the design parameters pose challenges in their mechanical layout and fabrication. While the conventional robot design follows a coherent and well-established design process, the construction of origami robots requires close study of their three-dimensional (3-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) geometries, compliant mechanisms, functional material specific components, and 2-D fabrication methods. In this paper, we report a systematic design methodology for building origami-inspired machines and robots based on these four essential design features. We provide their comprehensive formulation, comparing them to conventional robots and highlighting design challenges as well as potentials. We demonstrate the applicability of our procedure to the majority of origami robots in the literature and also validate it by designing a centimeter-scale jumping and crawling origami robot, Tribot, as a showcase. The 6-g Tribot crawls with fixed steps in a closed loop, adjusts its vertical jumping height by power modulation, and overcomes obstacles of 45-mm height by side jumps.

By pulling granule filled membrane-columns under vacuum, the columns and joint stiffen as the granular matter begin to jam. In our experiments, we achieved a four-fold increase in stiffness, and the stiffness can be achieved while the columns are straight or bent. Current flexible manipulators in industrial and medical robotics have followed two dominating methods of actuation and stiffness control. The first method is the continuum manipulator, which utilizes tendons or rods to bend the manipulator in a continuous fashion. The second method is classified as the highly articulated robot, where the manipulator is comprised of multiple segments linked by motor-driven universal joints. Like the latter, our manipulator is highly articulated, however stiffness of each joint can be independently controlled by the granular jamming principle. This paper studies the effect of grain type and vacuum pressure for stiffness tuning. We found that granules with a matte surface were able to achieve higher stiffnesses, with a cube shape exhibiting the highest stiffness, but at the cost of high levels of hysteresis.},

In particular, we investigated the extent to which the termination of a centrally initiated head movement in monkeys and the subsequent maintenance of posture depend on a readout of proprioceptive afferent input generated during the movement itself or are instead centrally programmed. We approached this question in two ways: first, using vestibulectomized, but otherwise intact monkeys, we applied load disturbances unexpectedly at the beginning and throughout centrally initiated head movements with the aim of provoking a proprioceptive response in all types of neck receptors and to observe the outcome of this stimulation on the head final position. In a second set of experiments, we interrupted the flow of afferent input by cutting cervical and upper thoracic dorsal roots and observed how the absence of proprioceptive feedback affects the achievement of final head position. The results indicated that the central pattern of neural impulses establishing final head position is preprogrammed and it is not reset by the afferent proprioceptive impulses generated during the intended movement. In addition, our findings are consistent with the view that final head position is an equilibrium point dependent on a number of factors, such as the firing rate and the recruitment of the alpha motoneurons, the length-tension properties of the muscles involved in posture, and passive elastic properties of external loads.},

As a trade-off, reducing interface stiffness also lowers zero motion force bandwidth. In this paper, the authors propose that for natural tasks, zero motion force bandwidth isn't everything, and incorporating series elasticity as a purposeful element within the actuator is a good idea. The authors use the term elasticity instead of compliance to indicate the presence of a passive mechanical spring in the actuator. After a discussion of the trade-offs inherent in series elastic actuators, the authors present a control system for their use under general force or impedance control.

	abstract = {Manipulators based on soft robotic technologies exhibit compliance and dexterity which ensures safe human–robot interaction. This article is a novel attempt at exploiting these desirable properties to develop a manipulator for an assistive application, in particular, a shower arm to assist the elderly in the bathing task. The overall vision for the soft manipulator is to concatenate three modules in a serial manner such that (i) the proximal segment is made up of cable-based actuation to compensate for gravitational effects and (ii) the central and distal segments are made up of hybrid actuation to autonomously reach delicate body parts to perform the main tasks related to bathing. The role of the latter modules is crucial to the application of the system in the bathing task; however, it is a nontrivial challenge to develop a robust and controllable hybrid actuated system with advanced manipulation capabilities and hence, the focus of this article. We first introduce our design and experimentally characterize its functionalities, which include elongation, shortening, omnidirectional bending. Next, we propose a control concept capable of solving the inverse kinetics problem using multiagent reinforcement learning to exploit these functionalities despite high dimensionality and redundancy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the design and control of this module by demonstrating an open-loop task space control where it successfully moves through an asymmetric 3-D trajectory sampled at 12 points with an average reaching accuracy of 0.79 cm ± 0.18 cm. Our quantitative experimental results present a promising step toward the development of the soft manipulator eventually contributing to the advancement of soft robotics.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a soft, inflatable manipulator that is antagonistically actuated by tendons and pneumatics. The combination of the two actuation mechanisms in this antagonistic robot structure is inspired by the octopus which uses its longitudinal and transversal muscles to steer, elongate, shrink and also stiffen its continuum arms. By “activating” its antagonistic muscle groups at the same time, the octopus can achieve multiple motion patterns as well as stiffen their arms. Being organized in a similar fashion, our robot manipulator uses, on the one hand, pneumatic actuation and, on the other hand, tendon-based actuation - one opposing the other, achieving an overall antagonistic actuation framework. Controlling the pressure inside the robot while at the same time controlling the tendons' displacements, the robot can be moved into a wide range of configurations while simultaneously controlling the arm's stiffness. This paper builds on earlier work by the authors: Here, we present a new conic-shaped manipulator structure and the control architecture. Using a constant curvature model, we have derived an approach suitable for controlling the robot manipulator. The manipulator's reachable workspace is analyzed and proof-of-concept experiments were conducted to show the robot's stiffness control and motion abilities.},

A kinematic analysis of the ECPAM is presented in this article. A new output force mathematical model has been developed for the ECPAM based on its kinematic analysis and the theory of energy conservation. The correlation between experimental results and the new mathematical model has been investigated and show good correlation. Numerous stiffness experiments have been conducted to validate the variable stiffness ability of the actuator at a series of specific fixed lengths. This has proven that actuator stiffness can be adjusted independently of actuator length. Finally, a stiffness-position controller has been developed to validate the effectiveness of the novel actuator.},

The muscles are roughly aligned in three directions, and by driving the muscles selectively, the octopus arm can perform multiple functions such as the contracting, bending, torsion and stiffness alteration. This study aims at the development of a new flexible robotic arm using thin McKibben actuators mimicking the muscle structure of an octopus arm. The McKibben actuator is a well-known pneumatic artificial muscle, and we have developed extremely thin McKibben actuators by using a braiding machine. In this paper, configuration of the flexible arm is proposed. The developed mechanism consists of thirty two thin McKibben actuators arranged in three directions, axial, radial and oblique, imitating the muscle structure of an actual octopus arm. The fundamental motion of the flexible arm is investigated experimentally. The proposed mechanism performs bending, contracting, torsion movements and stiffness alteration like an octopus arm.},

	abstract = {Current soft robotic arms commonly follow traditional—i.e. hard—robot design conventions. Omnidirectional soft arms most commonly consist of segments that contain three parallel longitudinal actuators, or actuator groups, of which one or two are activated to induce bending. This design uses the minimum number of actuators required for omnidirectional bending, which is consistent with traditional robot design but unnecessarily constrains the soft arm design space. The cephalopods that frequently inspire soft robot arms have tens of bundles of longitudinal muscle fibers, and these bundles are distributed around the limb circumference rather than grouped. This article analyzes fluid-driven soft arm architectures with up to 12 actuators, which mimics the redundant and distributed nature of cephalopod arms and tentacles, in order to investigate the performance implications of an arm morphology closer to nature. Overactuation (i.e. activating more than two actuators) was considered, which is possible because soft robots—unlike traditional robots—can tolerate misaligned or partially opposed actuation without jamming. A previously-developed generalizable model was used to simulate design performance, and a subset of the examined architectures were constructed and tested. Many-actuator soft arms achieve high strokes under equivalent load and equivalent actuation pressures, without sacrificing no-load reach. These arms are also able to achieve quasi-omnidirectionality, as well as to execute near constant-curvature turns using a simple actuation pattern and a single pressure signal. The introduced framework also enables non-circular cross sections that are not possible with minimalist arm designs, allowing the load capacity and reach to be tuned in multiple directions. Several elliptical cross section arms were analyzed to explore the potential of non-circular cross sections. Overactuated, many-actuator arms significantly expand the design space of soft arms, improving performance in some cases and introducing options to tailor behavior that are infeasible in structurally minimal arms.},

	abstract = {In mathematics, bicubic interpolation is an extension of cubic spline interpolation (a method of applying cubic interpolation to a data set) for interpolating data points on a two-dimensional regular grid. The interpolated surface (meaning the kernel shape, not the image) is smoother than corresponding surfaces obtained by bilinear interpolation or nearest-neighbor interpolation. Bicubic interpolation can be accomplished using either Lagrange polynomials, cubic splines, or cubic convolution algorithm.
In image processing, bicubic interpolation is often chosen over bilinear or nearest-neighbor interpolation in image resampling, when speed is not an issue. In contrast to bilinear interpolation, which only takes 4 pixels (2×2) into account, bicubic interpolation considers 16 pixels (4×4). Images resampled with bicubic interpolation can have different interpolation artifacts, depending on the b and c values chosen.},

On this line of thought, this paper considers the input decoupling problem for input-affine Lagrangian dynamics, namely the problem of finding a transformation of the generalized coordinates that decouples the input channels. We identify a class of systems for which this problem is solvable. Such systems are called collocated because the decoupling variables correspond to the coordinates on which the actuators directly perform work. Under mild conditions on the input matrix, a simple test is presented to verify whether a system is collocated or not. By exploiting power invariance, it is proven that a change of coordinates decouples the input channels if and only if the dynamics is collocated. We illustrate the theoretical results by considering several Lagrangian systems, focusing on underactuated mechanical systems, for which novel controllers that exploit input decoupling are designed.},

We propose to exploit principles of soft robotic technologies to design and control a compliant system to ensure safe human-robot interaction, a primary requirement for the task. The overall system is intended to be modular with a proximal segment that provides structural integrity to overcome gravitational challenges and a distal segment to perform the main bathing activities. The focus of this letter is on the design and control of the latter module. The design comprises of alternating tendons and pneumatics in a radial arrangement, which enables elongation, contraction, and omnidirectional bending. Additionally, a synergetic coactivation of cables and tendons in a given configuration allows for stiffness modulation, which is necessary to facilitate washing and scrubbing. The novelty of the work is twofold: 1) Three base cases of antagonistic actuation are identified that enable stiffness variation. Each category is then experimentally characterized by the application of an external force that imposes a linear displacement at the tip in both axial and lateral directions. 2) The development of a novel algorithm based on cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning that simultaneously optimizes stiffness and position. The results highlight the effectiveness of the design and control to contribute toward the development of the assistive device.},

The lack of a fast and accurate simulator prevents motion planners from generating feasible plans, which would enable soft robots to achieve more complex tasks, such as manipulation. In this work, we propose combining a simplified quasistatic model with a neural network that learns to compensate for unmodeled forces, such as friction and loads, in order to create a fast forward model for soft manipulators with multiple segments. We show that the resulting neural network model reduces average end effector position error by 62\% compared to the quasistatic model, while still being fast enough for motion planning. We also incorporate this model into an RRT*-based planner and demonstrate that the plans generated using our model are more likely to be feasible when executed on hardware than plans generated with a simulator using the quasistatic model.},

	abstract = {Muscular hydrostats, such as octopus arms or elephant trunks, lack bones entirely, endowing them with exceptional dexterity and reconfigurability. Key to their unmatched ability to control nearly infinite degrees of freedom is the architecture into which muscle fibers are weaved. Their arrangement is, effectively, the instantiation of a sophisticated mechanical program that mediates, and likely facilitates, the control and realization of complex, dynamic morphological reconfigurations. Here, by combining medical imaging, biomechanical data, live behavioral experiments and numerical simulations, we synthesize a model octopus arm entailing {\textasciitilde}200 continuous muscles groups, and begin to unravel its complexity. We show how 3D arm motions can be understood in terms of storage, transport, and conversion of topological quantities, effected by simple muscle activation templates. These, in turn, can be composed into higher-level control strategies that, compounded by the arm's compliance, are demonstrated in a range of object manipulation tasks rendered additionally challenging by the need to appropriately align suckers, to sense and grasp. Overall, our work exposes broad design and algorithmic principles pertinent to muscular hydrostats, robotics, and dynamics, while significantly advancing our ability to model muscular structures from medical imaging, with potential implications for human health and care.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the problem of estimating (interpolating and smoothing) the shape (pose and the six modes of deformation) of a slender flexible body from multiple camera measurements. This problem is important in both biology, where slender, soft, and elastic structures are ubiquitously encountered across species, and in engineering, particularly in the area of soft robotics. The proposed mathematical formulation for shape estimation is physics-informed, based on the use of the special Cosserat rod theory whose equations encode slender body mechanics in the presence of bending, shearing, twisting and stretching. The approach is used to derive numerical algorithms which are experimentally demonstrated for fiber reinforced and cable-driven soft robot arms. These experimental demonstrations show that the methodology is accurate ({\textless}5 mm error, three times less than the arm diameter) and robust to noise and uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Dynamic motions are a key feature of robotic arms, enabling them to perform tasks quickly and efficiently. A majority of real-world soft robots rely on a quasistatic control approach, without taking dynamic characteristics into consideration. As a result, robots with this restriction move slowly and are not able to adequately deal with forces, such as handling unexpected perturbations or manipulating objects. A dynamic approach to control and modeling would allow soft robots to move faster and handle external forces more efficiently. In previous studies, different aspects of modeling, dynamic control, and physical implementation have been examined separately, while their combination has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Herein, the accuracy of the dynamic model of the multisegment continuum robot is improved by adding new elements that include variable stiffness and actuation behavior. Then, this improved model is integrated with state-of-the-art system identification and dynamic task space control and experiments are performed to validate this combination on a real-world manipulator. As a means of encouraging future research on dynamic control for soft robotic manipulators, the source code is made available for modeling, control, and system identification, along with the recipes for fabricating the manipulator.},

The interaction mechanics between the compliant body and unknown environment present significant challenges for traditional robot control techniques based on modeling these interactions exactly. In this letter, we describe a hybrid position/force control method that uses a model-less approach. Model-less control is a recently-described approach to control that learns the continuum manipulator Jacobian and adapts to constraints in the environment in a safe manner. When interacting with the environment using the end-effector, these tip-constraints can affect the manipulator Jacobian estimates to become ill-conditioned. This letter addresses this issue by defining a hybrid control approach for simultaneously controlling end-effector position and forces while still maintaining the minimalist approach of model-less control. Under this method, continuum manipulators can safely and effectively interact with the environment, even when these interactions are arbitrary and unknown constraints.},

We also contextually introduce a strategy to approximate this model at any level of detail through a finite dimensional system. First, we analyze the main mathematical properties of this model in the case of lightweight and non lightweight soft robots. Then, we prove that using the constant term of curvature as control output produces a minimum phase system, in this way providing the theoretical support that existing curvature control techniques lack, and at the same time opening up to the use of advanced nonlinear control techniques. Finally, we propose a new controller, i.e., the PD-poly, which exploits information on high order deformations, to achieve zero steady state regulation error in presence of gravity and generic nonconstant curvature conditions.},

	abstract = {Tendons are a widely used actuation strategy for continuum robots that enable forces and moments to be transmitted along the robot from base-mounted actuators. Most prior robots have used tendons routed in straight paths along the robot. However, routing tendons through general curved paths within the robot offers potential advantages in reshaping the workspace and enabling a single section of the robot to achieve a wider variety of desired shapes. In this paper, we provide a new model for the statics and dynamics of robots with general tendon routing paths that is derived by coupling the classical Cosserat-rod and Cosserat-string models. This model also accounts for general external loading conditions and includes traditional axially routed tendons as a special case. The advantage of the usage of this coupled model for straight-tendon robots is that it accounts for the distributed wrenches that tendons apply along the robot. We show that these are necessary to consider when the robot is subjected to out-of-plane external loads. Our experimental results demonstrate that the coupled model matches experimental tip positions with an error of 1.7\% of the robot length, in a set of experiments that include both straight and nonstraight routing cases, with both point and distributed external loads. © 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Continuum and soft robots can leverage complex actuator shapes to take on useful shapes while actuating only a few of their many degrees of freedom. Continuum robots that also grow increase the range of potential shapes that can be actuated and enable easier access to constrained environments. Existing models for describing the complex kinematics involved in general actuation of continuum robots rely on simulation or well-behaved stress-strain relationships, but the non-linear behavior of the thin-walled inflated-beams used in growing robots makes these techniques difficult to apply. Here we derive kinematic models of single, generally routed tendon paths on a soft pneumatic backbone of inextensible but flexible material from geometric relationships alone. This allows for forward modeling of the resulting shapes with only knowledge of the geometry of the system. We show that this model can accurately predict the shape of the whole robot body and how the model changes with actuation type. We also demonstrate the use of this kinematic model for inverse design, where actuator designs are found based on desired final robot shapes. We deploy these designed actuators on soft pneumatic growing robots to show the benefits of simultaneous growth and shape change.},
